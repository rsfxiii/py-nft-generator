# The order of placement in the layers array determines the z-index placement of the layers in the final image.
# The higher the item in the list, the closer to the background the layer will be located.
# The background should always be at the back of the image, in the background, hence the name, so it's the first in the list.
# If the directory does not exist, it should be created for convenience - it is expected within the assets directory

  - name: rarity-banner

# Because they are stated here, these are expected to occur as directories within each layer's directory

# If they do not exist, they will be created for convenience

  - common
  - uncommon
  - rare

# trait_distributions are definitions on the categories of NFTs in the token collection.
# Note: Frequencies must always add up to 100 in total
# These values will be used to determine drop percentage when choosing layers assets from categories
